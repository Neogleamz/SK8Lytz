### 🚑 TRIAGE QUEUE

- [ ] **`fix/supabase-db-security-advisors`**
  - **Tags:** `[📝 NEEDS PLAN]` `[DB]` `[⚠️ H-RISK]` `[🥩 Feast]` `[🤖 PRO-HIGH]`
  - **Goal:** Fix Supabase security advisors: SECURITY DEFINER views, mutable search_path, RLS disabled on public.spatial_ref_sys, and always-true RLS policies.
  - **Decision Log:** Logged by /health-sweep during /ship-it Phase 1. High security risk preventing release.
  - **Details:** 5 major flags including ERRORs on telemetry views and disabled RLS on spatial_ref_sys.

- [ ] **`fix/gatt-conn-133-exception`**
  - **Tags:** `[📝 NEEDS PLAN]` `[LAB]` `[M-RISK]` `[Snack]` `[🤖 PRO-HIGH]`

### 🔥 ON DECK

### ⚡ [BATCH:fix/ble-connection-pipeline] — `fix/ble-connection-pipeline` — READY
> **Worktree**: `fix/ble-connection-pipeline` · **Type**: Sequential (unified) · **Prerequisite**: None
> **Source Analysis**: 📊 [connection_pipeline_audit.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4d36a4af-a431-4005-8193-df3fb92727c5/connection_pipeline_audit.md) — 5-agent parallel audit of BLE connection lifecycle (7 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM findings)

### ⏳ [BATCH:fix/autoconnect-dashboard-stale] — `fix/autoconnect-dashboard-stale` — READY
> **Worktree**: `fix/autoconnect-dashboard-stale` · **Type**: Solo · **Prerequisite**: [BATCH:fix/ble-connection-pipeline] merged
> **Source Analysis**: 📊 [connection_pipeline_audit.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4d36a4af-a431-4005-8193-df3fb92727c5/connection_pipeline_audit.md) — cloud MAC case mismatch + stale ref + wrong deviceConfigs key

- [/] **`fix/autoconnect-dashboard-stale`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[BLE]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🍪 Snack]` `[🧠 LOW]` `[BATCH:fix/autoconnect-dashboard-stale]` `[WAVE:2]`
  - **Goal:** Fix cloud sync MAC case mismatch in auto-connect, sync stale allDevicesRef, and correct renderItem deviceConfigs lookup key.
  - **Decision Log:** Audit found cloud sync path uses raw device_mac without .toUpperCase() (H6 — same class of bug we just fixed in buildOfflineGroupMap), allDevicesRef never synced after init (M1), renderItem looks up deviceConfigs by Supabase composite key instead of MAC (L4).
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [connection_pipeline_audit.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4d36a4af-a431-4005-8193-df3fb92727c5/connection_pipeline_audit.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-autoconnect-dashboard-stale.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-autoconnect-dashboard-stale.md)
    Key finding: "Cloud sync path at L396 uses raw device_mac — same .toUpperCase() bug we just fixed in buildOfflineGroupMap"
    Rejected alternative: "Canonicalizing all MACs to lowercase — rejected because BLE Device.id is uppercase by convention on both platforms"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [useDashboardAutoConnect.ts](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/hooks/useDashboardAutoConnect.ts#L396-L405) §cloudSync
  - **Details:** 4 surgical edits across useDashboardAutoConnect.ts and DashboardScreen.tsx. Prerequisite: Wave 1 fully merged into master before this worktree is created.

### 🧹 Tech Debt & Upgrades
### ⚡ [BATCH:refactor/upgrade-expo-56] — `refactor/upgrade-expo-56` — IN PROGRESS
> **Worktree**: `refactor/upgrade-expo-56` · **Type**: Sequential · **Prerequisite**: None
> **Source Analysis**: 📊 [implementation_plan.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/fb5fb761-e7be-4241-a902-3cb07dca3307/implementation_plan.md) — User explicitly requested forcing a major dependency update (Expo 55->56) mid-release to resolve deep-tree js-yaml vulnerabilities.

- [ ] **`refactor/upgrade-expo-56`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[☁️ CLOUD]` `[⚠️ H-RISK]` `[🥩 Feast]` `[🤖 M132]` `[BATCH:refactor/upgrade-expo-56]`
  - **Goal:** Upgrade the project from Expo SDK 55 to 56, including React Native 0.85, to wipe out all outstanding NPM vulnerabilities.
  - **Decision Log:** User explicitly requested during `/ship-it` to override release freeze and force a full dependency update.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Plan: [PLAN-refactor-upgrade-expo-56.md](./plans/PLAN-refactor-upgrade-expo-56.md)
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [package.json](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/package.json)
  - **Details:** High risk of breaking custom native modules and legacy UI components due to React Native 0.85 bridging changes.
