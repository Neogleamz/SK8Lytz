## 🚧 ACTIVE SPRINT

- `[/]` **`fix/js-yaml-audit`** — Add js-yaml override to resolve npm audit block on push.
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[❌ UNVERIFIED]` `[APP]` `[L-RISK]` `[Snack]` `[BATCH:audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:12]`
  - **Source of Truth:** [PLAN-fix-js-yaml-audit.md](file:///C:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/docs/plans/PLAN-fix-js-yaml-audit.md)
  - **Decision Log:** Vulnerability is dev-only, but strict pre-push requires zero-moderate audit. Override is the safest minimal fix.

#### 🌊 Wave 1 — BLE Pipeline & Quick Wins (Parallel-Safe)

- [ ] **`fix/group-concurrent-write`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[BLE]` `[⚠️ H-RISK]` `[🍱 Meal]` `[🧠 THINK]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:1]`
  - **Goal:** Replace `Promise.all(targets.map(...))` with sequential `for...of` loops in group BLE dispatch to prevent GATT write collisions.
  - **Decision Log:** Deep-dive R-10 sniper + DOMAIN_GROUP_SYNC + DOMAIN_BLE_CORE confirmed 11 concurrent write violations across 4 files. GATT controller expects sequential device-by-device dispatch — parallel writes cause collision and packet loss on grouped skates.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-group-concurrent-write.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-group-concurrent-write.md)
    Key finding: "7 Promise.all(targets.map) in useControllerDispatch.ts bypass write queue serialization"
    Rejected alternative: "Adding mutex locks in BleWriteQueue — unnecessary, queue already serializes per-device"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [useControllerDispatch.ts](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/hooks/useControllerDispatch.ts#L94) §BLE Dispatch
  - **Details:** 4 files, 11 locations. BLE pipeline — wrong fix risks bricking skates.

- [ ] **`fix/protocol-seq-counter`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[BLE]` `[⚠️ H-RISK]` `[🍱 Meal]` `[🧠 THINK]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:1]`
  - **Goal:** Fix sequence counter split-ownership in `0x40` chunked payload framing and replace hardcoded 54-pixel max with dynamic `numLeds`.
  - **Decision Log:** DOMAIN_PROTOCOL_CORE confirmed BleWriteDispatcher uses `Math.random()` for seqNum while ZenggeProtocol has a proper incrementing counter. Protocol Bible §0x51 mandates `seqNum increments per save operation`. Split ownership = out-of-sequence frames = silently dropped pixels.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-protocol-seq-counter.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-protocol-seq-counter.md)
    Key finding: "Dual sequence counter increment causes frame drops on 0x40 chunked payloads"
    Rejected alternative: "TransitionType 0x00→CASCADE mapping — confirmed FALSE POSITIVE by plan writer"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [ZenggeAdapter.ts](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/protocols/ZenggeAdapter.ts#L167) §Protocol Core
  - **Details:** 4 files, 5 locations. Byte-level payload pipeline — wrong values = physical LED corruption.

- [ ] **`fix/pii-scrub-sweep`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[APP]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🍪 Snack]` `[🤖 FLASH]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:1]`
  - **Goal:** Wrap all unscrubbed PII (deviceId, name, crewName) in AppLogger calls with `scrubPII()` utility.
  - **Decision Log:** R-09 sniper found 16 instances of unscrubbed PII reaching cloud telemetry. Plan writer reduced to 14 confirmed fixes after dropping 2 false positives (DEV-gated log, pattern label string).
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-pii-scrub-sweep.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-pii-scrub-sweep.md)
    Key finding: "14 unscrubbed PII values in production AppLogger calls across 7 files"

  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[UI]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🍪 Snack]` `[🤖 FLASH]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:1]`
  - **Goal:** Fix 3 OS variance parity violations: missing Android elevation and web-specific styles not wrapped in `Platform.select`.
  - **Decision Log:** R-20 sniper confirmed 3 verified violations. `countdownBadge` missing Android elevation causes invisible shadow. CustomSlider/TacticalSlider merge web-only styles on all platforms.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-os-variance-parity.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-os-variance-parity.md)
    Key finding: "3 style definitions with iOS/web shadows but no Android elevation"
    Rejected alternative: "N/A — straightforward style fixes"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [DashboardStyles.ts](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/styles/DashboardStyles.ts#L105) §Styles
  - **Details:** 3 files, 3 locations. Style-only changes.

  - **Goal:** Resolve 3 split-brain architectural defects: GroupRepository read bypass, protocol dispatch hardcode, and crew stats race condition.
  - **Decision Log:** R-21 structural sniper + DOMAIN_PROTOCOL_CORE confirmed 3 disjoint code paths that should converge. GroupRepository is a write-only sink, useControllerDispatch hardcodes Zengge instead of using adapter registry, and useCrewSession duplicates lifetime stats writes causing race conditions.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-split-brain-trifecta.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-split-brain-trifecta.md)
    Key finding: "3 independent code paths bypass their canonical repositories"
    Rejected alternative: "Rewriting GroupRepository with RxJS observable streams — overengineered for current needs"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [GroupRepository.ts](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/services/GroupRepository.ts) §Architecture
  - **Details:** 5 files across 3 domains. Prerequisite: Wave 1 fully merged into master before this worktree is created.

- [ ] **`fix/ble-core-type-safety`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[BLE]` `[⚠️ H-RISK]` `[🍱 Meal]` `[🧠 THINK]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:2]`
  - **Goal:** Eliminate all `any` type casts from BLE core production services and fix the Device/DisplayDevice type hierarchy.
  - **Decision Log:** R-08 sniper + DOMAIN_BLE_CORE confirmed 11 `any` casts in production BLE services + 9 `as unknown as` casts in DashboardScreen indicating broken type hierarchy. Plan makes `DisplayDevice extends Device` to eliminate casts at the type system level.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-ble-core-type-safety.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-ble-core-type-safety.md)
    Key finding: "DisplayDevice and Device type hierarchies are disjoint, causing 9 forced casts"
    Rejected alternative: "Adapter functions at each cast site — eliminated by making DisplayDevice extend Device"

  - **Details:** 7 files, ~20 locations. Prerequisite: Wave 1 fully merged into master before this worktree is created.

- [ ] **`fix/promise-io-guards`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[CLOUD]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🍱 Meal]` `[🤖 FLASH]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:2]`
  - **Goal:** Add try/catch guards and .catch() handlers to all unguarded async IO operations to prevent unhandled promise rejections.
  - **Decision Log:** R-11 sniper + DOMAIN_NOTIFICATIONS_&_ROUTING confirmed 15 unguarded async ops. 3 HIGH severity (AppConfigContext, AppLoggerStorage, LocationService) can crash silently and cause data loss.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-promise-io-guards.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-promise-io-guards.md)
    Key finding: "AppLoggerStorage uses console.warn instead of AppLogger.warn to prevent re-entrant logging loops"
    Rejected alternative: "Global unhandledrejection handler — masks bugs instead of fixing them"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [AppConfigContext.tsx](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/context/AppConfigContext.tsx#L25) §IO Safety

- [ ] **`fix/reentrant-handler-guards`**
  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[UI]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🍱 Meal]` `[🤖 FLASH]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:3]`
  - **Goal:** Add re-entrancy guards (`isProcessing` ref pattern) to all async UI handler functions that interact with BLE or Supabase.
  - **Decision Log:** R-26 sniper found 28 unguarded async handlers. Double-tap on `handleStartScan`, `handleLeave`, `handleJoinByCode` causes BLE races, orphaned sessions, and duplicate database entries.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-reentrant-handler-guards.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-reentrant-handler-guards.md)
    Key finding: "Shared refs for mutually exclusive handlers within the same component"
    Rejected alternative: "Disabling buttons during processing — already exists as UI state, but ref guard is the synchronous first-line defense"
  - **Source of Truth:** 📖 [HardwareSetupWizardScreen.tsx](file:///c:/Neogleamz/AG_SK8Lytz_App/SK8Lytz/src/screens/Onboarding/HardwareSetupWizardScreen.tsx) §UI Safety

  - **Tags:** `[✅ READY]` `[🤔 INFERRED]` `[UI]` `[✅ L-RISK]` `[🥩 Feast]` `[🤖 FLASH]` `[BATCH:deepdive-audit-sweep]` `[WAVE:3]`
  - **Goal:** Replace disjoint loading/error/success boolean state variables with unified FSM `ViewState` string unions across 20 files.
  - **Decision Log:** R-14 sniper found 38 boolean trap violations. 3-tier approach: full FSM conversion (10 files), hybrid cleanup (4 files), error normalization (6 files). Creates shared `ViewState` type.
  - **Analysis:** 📊 Source: [system_audit_report.md](file:///C:/Users/Magma/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a2899729-4d77-4e6c-8f8c-d23919eb2b74/system_audit_report.md) · Plan: [PLAN-fix-fsm-state-matrix.md](./plans/PLAN-fix-fsm-state-matrix.md)
    Key finding: "38 components use disjoint booleans instead of FSM string unions"
    Rejected alternative: "XState for UI views — overkill, string unions sufficient for non-BLE state"
