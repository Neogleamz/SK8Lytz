All active tasks, bugs, and feature work. Prioritized. Updated every session.

---

## 🔴 High Priority / Next Up

<!-- AUTO_SYNC_ERRORS_START -->
<!-- AUTO_SYNC_ERRORS_END -->

- [x] `fix/camera-mode-wipeout` : Restore CAMERA mode UI in DockedController (regression fix) + Web Fallback Simulation.
- [x] `feat/auth-branding-link` : Add "by neogleamz.com" credited link below logo on AuthScreen.
- [ ] `fix/dynamic-arch-regressions` : Resolve 'isHaloz' ReferenceError in ProductVisualizer and perform a sanitization audit (DockedController, ZenggeProtocol, Setup Wizard) to remove remaining hardcoded binary logic.
- [ ] `feat/battery-health-predict` : Mathematical power modeling to predict battery life based on pattern draw; auto-dims to 20% at critical reserve.
- [ ] `hw-test/protocol-voltage-sniff` : Deep-dive into 0x63 response and other telemetry bytes to identify raw battery voltage / state-of-charge data.
- [ ] `feat/voice-command-engine` : Hands-free voice control mapping natural language to BLE payloads for safe operation while skating.
- [ ] `feat/geofence-rink-sync` : GPS-based rink detection to auto-trigger Crew Hub discovery and session joining.

### Target: `epic/offline-mode`

- [ ] `gate-offline-mode` : Gate off online capabilities when in offline mode (Crew Hub, Community Favorites, SK8Lytz Picks). Ensure Crew Hub card stays on dashboard but displays an "Offline" warning.

### Target: `epic/device-registration`

### Target: `epic/crew-hub-overhaul`

- [ ] `refactor-crew-modal` : #3 — `CrewModal.tsx` refactor — 14 useEffect hooks, 2,600+ lines. Extract `useCrewHub()` and `useCrewSession()` custom hooks. Highest maintainability debt in the codebase.
- [ ] `feat/advanced-map-integration` : Verify and rework map integration in Crew Hub and "Live Near Me" (post-modal rebuild). Add a live map showing the selected radius and a dot for the session location. Also beef up map integration within the scheduler.

### Target: `epic/music-mode-parity`

- [ ] `lab-music-mode-parity` : #13 — Lab 0x73 Music Mode parity — Lab BUILDER's 0x73 section is missing Light Screen (0x27) vs Light Bar (0x26) matrix style toggle, primary/secondary color pickers, and mic source.
- [ ] `fix-music-mode-color` : #14 — Music Mode: Sound column/drop color not applied — Main app music mode is functioning but color changes for patterns using "sound column" and "drop" effects are not being accepted/applied.

---

## 🟠 Medium Priority / Next Sprint

### Target: `epic/admin-tools`

- [ ] `feat/picks-scheduler-builder` : Revise the SK8Lytz picks scheduler algorithms to finalize the assignment mode logic, and integrate an administrative version of the array builder to create custom community picks on the fly. also allow access to patterns in program mode for assignment

### Target: `epic/camera-mode`

### Target: `epic/visualizer-parity`

- [ ] `tune-visualizer-pro-effects` : #15 — Visualizer Parity: Pro Effects Patterns — Exhaustively review and tune the interpolation mathematics for all 33 of the 'pro effects' patterns to make them physically accurate within the product visualizer.

### Target: `epic/device-management`

- [x] `feat/dynamic-product-architecture` : Prepare app for new products by migrating hardware configurations (LED points, segments, auto-detect thresholds, visualizer mapping) from hardcoded constants to a Supabase-backed catalog with local caching and an admin UI layer.

### Target: `epic/protocol-integration`

- [ ] `feat/hardware-abstraction-layer` : Architect a hardware controller abstraction layer to decouple the UI from explicit `ZenggeProtocol` functions, preparing the app to support and dynamically map new OEM hardware controllers to the existing UI.

### Target: `epic/ui-refinement`

- [ ] `audit/offline-profile-settings` : Audit whether all user profile settings (display name, avatar, preferences) are fully cached locally for offline use. Implement offline-safe username rename that queues the update to Supabase on reconnect — same pattern as device registration sync.

---

## 🟡 Backlog

### Target: `epic/telemetry-audit`

### Target: `epic/security-audit`

- [ ] `audit-rls-performance` : #20 — Security & Performance Review — Routine RLS audit on Supabase queries; optimize React Native render cycles for dashboard gauges.
- [ ] `fix/typescript-debt-audit` : Resolve pre-existing TS errors across the codebase: dead state vars (`setDemoHaloQueued/SoulQueued`) in DashboardScreen, `CustomGroup` type drift, `'UNKNOWN'` product type overlap in HardwareSetupWizard, missing `group_id` in useRegistration legacy migration helper, missing EventType entries in PositionalGradientBuilder, and implicit `any` params in LocationService.

### Target: `epic/community-hub`

- [ ] `integrate-builder-presets` : #27 — Community Hub: Builder Preset Integration — Allow users to submit and pull Custom Builder Presets using the public `shared_scenes` Community Library.

### Target: `epic/ui-refinement`

- [ ] `feat/lab-ui-modernization` : Modernize and style the LED Diagnostic Lab layout to match the aesthetics, typography, and input styling of the rest of the app.
- [x] `feat/light-mode-rework` : Rework light mode UI theme to use soft grey instead of stark white, dark blue instead of black, and brand orange where possible.
- [ ] `feat/neogleamz-brand-presence` : Integrate Neogleamz parent brand identity into the app — e.g. "SK8Lytz by Neogleamz" wordmark, prominent Neogleamz branding on the Auth/Welcome screen, app store identity alignment. Design direction TBD — will brainstorm placement and treatment before executing.

## ❄️ Icebox / Backburner (Manual Trigger Only)

*Items placed here are explicitly ignored by the automatic queue. They will act as a catalog for future features that require manual authorization to begin work on.*

- [ ] `add-swipe-nav` : #34 — Card Swipe Navigation — Add the ability to swipe left and right to navigate back and forth between cards (Favorites, Picks, Presets) for a more fluid mobile UX.

- [x] `feat/global-error-telemetry` : Integrate a global error boundary and remote crash reporting solution (e.g., Sentry or Supabase Edge logging) to automatically capture, diagnose, and push unhandled exceptions without user intervention. this should add items to bucket list for us to review and fix.
- [x] `audit-applogger-coverage` : #30 — AppLogger Coverage Audit — Comprehensive audit of all features added this session (Street Mode, Picks, Favorites, Builder) to ensure 100% telemetry coverage in Analytics.
- [x] `verify-telemetry-ingestion` : #21 — Telemetry ingestion verification — Confirm AppLogger events (crew, street mode, hardware config) are landing in Supabase `device_logs` table correctly.

- [x] `fix/hardware-setup-guide-url` : Fix the URL for the 'View Installation Guide' link on the Hardware Setup screen
- [x] `audit-admin-hardware` : #7 — Admin Hardware Tester audit — Verify `setMultiColor` path in admin tester applies color sorting correctly (currently does NOT call `applyColorSorting` — review `AdminHardwareTester.tsx` L169).
- [x] `build-picks-scheduler` : #28 — SK8Lytz Picks Admin Scheduler — Build admin UI to manage the `sk8lytz_picks` table scheduling. DB columns (`active_from`, `active_until`, `is_active`) already in place. Goal: seasonal picks (4th of July, Christmas, etc.) auto-show/hide. Needs: admin screen, date pickers, toggle per pick. needs to under hidden tool section
