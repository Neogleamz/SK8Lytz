## 🔴 High Priority / Next Up

### Target: `epic/device-registration`

- [x] `review-device-reg` : Device Registration & Claim Process Review — Revisiting the user-to-device ownership flow. Need to brainstorm and build a new implementation plan as the previous extensive one was lost.
- [x] `ftue-initial-setup` : FTUE Phase 1 - Create HardwareSetupWizardScreen with probe scan logic and instructions.
- [x] `ftue-probe-discovery` : FTUE Phase 2 - Build device discovery list, product identification logic (LED count), and Blink test.
- [x] `ftue-claim-registration` : FTUE Phase 3 - Wire offline/online claiming via useRegistration.ts and UI portal integration.
- [x] `sandbox-testing` : Establish Dev Sandbox — Move Nuke button to Auth, inject Dead-Code eliminated BLE mocks directly into useBLE hook, and clear stale Dashboard mock logic.
- [x] `ftue-grouping-config` : FTUE Phase 4 - Add Mini Hardware Config for assigned positioning and auto-grouping generation.
- [x] `fix/hardware-setup-guide-url` : Fix the URL for the 'View Installation Guide' link on the Hardware Setup screen

### Target: `epic/crew-hub-overhaul`

- [ ] `refactor-crew-modal` : #3 — `CrewModal.tsx` refactor — 14 useEffect hooks, 2,600+ lines. Extract `useCrewHub()` and `useCrewSession()` custom hooks. Highest maintainability debt in the codebase.

### Target: `epic/music-mode-parity`

- [ ] `lab-music-mode-parity` : #13 — Lab 0x73 Music Mode parity — Lab BUILDER's 0x73 section is missing Light Screen (0x27) vs Light Bar (0x26) matrix style toggle, primary/secondary color pickers, and mic source.
- [ ] `fix-music-mode-color` : #14 — Music Mode: Sound column/drop color not applied — Main app music mode is functioning but color changes for patterns using "sound column" and "drop" effects are not being accepted/applied.

---

## 🟠 Medium Priority / Next Sprint

### Target: `epic/admin-tools`

- [ ] `audit-admin-hardware` : #7 — Admin Hardware Tester audit — Verify `setMultiColor` path in admin tester applies color sorting correctly (currently does NOT call `applyColorSorting` — review `AdminHardwareTester.tsx` L169).
- [ ] `build-picks-scheduler` : #28 — SK8Lytz Picks Admin Scheduler — Build admin UI to manage the `sk8lytz_picks` table scheduling. DB columns (`active_from`, `active_until`, `is_active`) already in place. Goal: seasonal picks (4th of July, Christmas, etc.) auto-show/hide. Needs: admin screen, date pickers, toggle per pick. needs to under hidden tool section

### Target: `epic/camera-mode`

- [x] `fix-camera-touch` : #8 — Camera Mode: Touch Precision fix — Color picker swatch is sampling too large an area. Touch/tap should sample ONLY the pixel directly under the finger and run the existing color enhancement routine on that single pixel.

### Target: `epic/visualizer-parity`

- [ ] `tune-visualizer-pro-effects` : #15 — Visualizer Parity: Pro Effects Patterns — Exhaustively review and tune the interpolation mathematics for all 33 of the 'pro effects' patterns to make them physically accurate within the product visualizer.

### Target: `epic/device-management`

- [ ] `audit-device-grouping` : #16 — Device Grouping Audit & Redesign — A "ghost group" keeps persisting across installs. Audit all grouping logic in `DashboardScreen.tsx`, `AsyncStorage`, and `registered_groups`.

### Target: `epic/protocol-integration`

- [x] `remove-protocol-setcolor` : #23 — `setColor()` in ZenggeProtocol — Does NOT apply color sorting. Should be removed or marked internal-only.
- [x] `audit-0x81-command` : #24 — `0x81` legacy command audit — Confirm it's no longer being sent on connect. `0x62` (EEPROM write) is the correct command. Remove any remaining `0x81` calls.

### Target: `epic/ui-refinement`

- [ ] `modern-rgb-slider` : #29 — Modern RGB Hue Slider — Design and implement a more sophisticated, high-precision RGB hue selection component to replace the standard sliders. Give me 3 choices and let me choose before moving on

- [ ] `audit-applogger-coverage` : #30 — AppLogger Coverage Audit — Comprehensive audit of all features added this session (Street Mode, Picks, Favorites, Builder) to ensure 100% telemetry coverage in Analytics.

## ✅ Completed This Session (Apr 2026)

- [x] `#10` — Street Mode: Tail light dimming — Absolute brightness: 100% braking (R=255), 50% cruising (R=127), not slider-scaled
- [x] `#11` — Visualizer Street Mode parity — `motionState` prop drives tail opacity and cruise bounce in visualizer
- [x] `#12` — Dashboard Header Layout — User pill left-justified, Support & Theme icons right-grouped, matching Auth screen style
- [x] `#25` — Builder UI Enhancement — ADD PIN moved into visual map as blank circular pin
